# contributing


we welcome everyone to contribute however we do some strange things here.


most notibly:
* when handling errors, we use MASMException everywhere we can to allow people to create their own apps around our project.
we also have IncludeErrors too which is mainly for just the include section but is designed closely with MASMException.
